# DiskSpeed CLI macOS

> ⚡️ **Native macOS terminal tool to benchmark disk read/write speed — safely, instantly, and without bloat.**

A lightweight, dependency-free script to **measure storage performance** on any Mac — internal SSD, external drive, SD card, or APFS volume.  
Uses only built-in macOS tools (`dd`, `df`, `osascript`) and works out of the box on **macOS 10.10 through Sequoia (15)**.

Perfect for developers, sysadmins, or curious users who want real-world disk speed — **without risking data or installing third-party apps**.

## ▶️ Quick Start

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x diskspeed
```
and run.

If run without arguments, the script will open a Finder dialog to select a disk, and the test file size will be 1 GB.

With arguments, usage is as follows:

```bash
./diskspeed --p "/Volumes/My SSD" --s 512
```
or
```bash
./diskspeed --path /Volumes/MySSD --size 512
```

File size is specified in **megabytes (MB)**.
